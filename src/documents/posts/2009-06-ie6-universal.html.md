title: Universal Internet Explorer 6 CSS
---

Today I’ve read an interesting article by Andy Clarke <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/universal_internet_explorer_6_css">here</a>.

Here’s the author’s key points:

* IE6 is hard to support

* it’s so cool to write CSS for modern browsers only

* sites shouldn’t look the same in different browsers

* people come to websites for content

So by throwing these thoughts in he’s making a conclusion that IE6 should be supported in a limited way – i.e. by giving it <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/demo/2009/05/21/ie6.0.3.css">a special “stripped” CSS</a>.

So let’s see.

## IE6 is hard to support
From technical side it’s not hard, period. The amount of effort depends on the project peculiarities (to a degree).

## It’s cool to write CSS for modern browsers only

Doing your work is not always doing cool stuff.

## Sites shouldn’t look the same in different browsers

It fully depends on the project peculiarities.

## People come to websites for content

It fully depends on the project peculiarities.

## I do keep saying that all this depends on the project peculiarities.

And I can’t understand why it’s not obvious to Andy Clarke. When a project is planned, all the issues are taken into consideration. As websites are displayed in different browsers, three key factors matter:

* **nature of the website**

* **market share of the browser**

* **cost of supporting a browser**

Do I need to explain in more detail?

P.S. Yes I think people should upgrade from IE6. But not because it has an outdated support for standards, but just because newer browsers provide much better user experience.

P.P.S. You know, Andy, I really appreciate what you’re doing. I urge you not to stop. I’ll be priced higher for the same skills that I have now just because you (and those whom you manage to convince) deliberately choose not to deliver what clients need :)

title: IE8 - important update!
---

<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/04/10/prepare-for-automatic-update-distribution-of-ie8.aspx">IE team says that starting from this week IE8 will be distributed as an important update</a>! Hooray! It will be marked as important update for Vista and Windows Server 2008. Hope most people will install it and weâ€™ll soon forget about IE6 and IE7 :)

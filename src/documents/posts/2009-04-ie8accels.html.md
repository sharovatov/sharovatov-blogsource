title: Various IE8 Accelerators - thepiratebay, php.net, pagerank, alexa
---

I recently updated to Internet Explorer 8, and it just rocks! One of the new shiny features that’s been added to IE8 is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc289775(VS.85).aspx">Web Accelerators</a>. I’ve just written some to make my life easier a bit. Hope you find them handy.

Search category:

* **<a href="http://sharovatov.ru/current.html#accelerators">Search on thepiratebay</a>** – just select any text on the page, wait for Accelerators icon, and click “Search on ThePirateBay” and it wil open you a new tab with search results

SEO category:

* **<a href="http://sharovatov.ru/current.html#accelerators">Check Google Pagerank</a>** of the page by its link – just right-click on any link, go to Accelerators, hover on “Check pagerank” and you’ll get it’s pagerank directly fetched from google.

* **<a href="http://sharovatov.ru/current.html#accelerators">Check Alexa rating</a>** of the page by its link – the same instructions – right click on a link, go to Accelerators, hover on “Check Alexa rating” and you’ll see this page’s Alexa rating in a preview window.

* **<a href="http://sharovatov.ru/current.html#accelerators">Check Alexa+pagerank</a>** – a little bit more useful Accelerator which combines both alexa and pagerank checks in one accelerator, but is hosted on my server – and again it shows Alexa rating and Google Pagerank on the preview screen.

Web-development:

* **<a href="http://sharovatov.ru/current.html#accelerators">PHP manual for selected property</a>** – just select a function name on the page, wait for the Accelerators icon to appear, click on “Search definition on php.net” and you’ll get a page with php.net manual loaded for this function

* **<a href="http://sharovatov.ru/current.html#accelerators">Validate a page</a>** – right click on any link to get the context menu, go to Accelerators and select “Validate a page” and you’ll get w3.org validator checking this link!

Remember, Accelerators work only in IE8, and clicking on these links in other browsers will just show the XML source of accelerators :)

It took me really half an hour to grasp the manual and write these six accelerators – thanks Microsoft for such an easy and productive platform.

P.S. And I've just created another one accelerator – “<a href="http://sharovatov.ru/current.html">Find broken links on a page</a>”. It allows you to use W3C links checker utility to quickly check if any of your links on the page are broken – just right click on a page to get the context menu, go to Accelerators and press “**Find broken links**” :) May be really useful.

I submitted four of my IE8 accelerators to a IE8 Addons gallery today and now waiting for approval :) Hope they will be approved and I’ll create more!

P.S. To submit your new Accelerator or Webslice, you need to register at <a href="http://www.ieaddons.com/gb/Register.aspx">ieaddons.com</a>, then go to the Upload page, provide name, description, screenshot and XML of your Accelerator and then wait for the approval :)

title: Useful JS tips - getBoundingClientRect()
---

What do you use to get element’s offset? Looping through its parents and summing offsetLeft/offsetTop numbers? I bet you had problems with it. Well, I did, especially when additional positioning context was generated by an element with position!=static.

10 years ago in IE5.0 Microsoft invented a better way - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536433(VS.85).aspx">getBoundingClientRect()</a> method.

It’s been <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2008/02/the_cssom_view.html">popularised by PPK</a>, specified in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#the-getclientrects">cssom-view spec</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Element.getBoundingClientRect">copied by Firefox 3</a>, Opera 9, Chrome 2, Safari; <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/getboundingclientrect-is-awesome/">used in jQuery</a>.

`element.getBoundingClientRect()` basically returns the object containing this element’s coordinates according to the window element. So you don’t have to do a loop, just call this method once and get the results. The only thing it doesn’t count for is scrolling offset, which can be calculated easily.

Extremely useful, thanks Microsoft IETeam!
